// Closures
// Swift lets us use functions just like any other type such as strings and integers.
// This means you can create a function and assign it to a variable, call that function
// using that variable, and even pass that function into other functions as parameters.

// Functions used in this way are called closures, and although they work like functions
// they are written a little differently.

let favoriteMovie = {
    print("Joel's favorite movie is Lord of the Rings")
}
favoriteMovie()


// Closure parameters

let driving = { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}
driving("the store")

let payUser = { (name: String, payment: Int) in
    print("\(name) just got paid \(payment) dollars")
}
payUser("Joel", 10000000)

    default:
        print("We don't have those.")
    }

pickFruit("strawberry")



// Returning value from a closure

let movieStar = { (name: String) -> String in
    return "\(name) is a movie star!"
}
let johnWick = movieStar("Keanu Reeves")
print(johnWick)



// Closures as parameters

let destination = {

// Trailing closure syntax

// original method
func animate(duration: Double, animations: () -> Void) {
    print("Starting a \(duration) second animationâ€¦")
    animations()
}

// simplified version without trailing closure
animate(duration: 3, animations: {
    print("Fade out the image")
})

// Trailing closures allow us to clean uo the closing braces }), while also removing the animations parameter label.
// That same function call becomes this:
animate(duration: 3) {
    print("Fade out the image")
}
